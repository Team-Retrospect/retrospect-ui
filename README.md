A simple yet powerful user interface for using Retrospect

## Installation with docker-compose.yml file

Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Team-Retrospect/docker-files) file

The UI should start automatically in the browser. If not, it will be running on port 3200. If you are running the application locally, navigate to localhost:3200.
